# LV Panels Copper Tracking System

The LV Panels Copper Tracking System is a comprehensive tool designed to manage and track the flow of copper throughout the lifecycle of a contract, from purchase to final audit. This system ensures efficient monitoring, reduces waste, and optimizes the use of copper in your projects.

## Features

### 1. Purchase

When a new contract is initiated, an order is placed for the required amount of copper. This quantity is recorded in the system through a form, and the data is securely stored in the database.

### 2. Delivery

Copper orders typically arrive in multiple shipments. On the delivery page, users can update the system with the received quantities. By selecting the appropriate contract, users can modify the existing data to reflect the partial deliveries and save these updates in the database.

### 3. Issue

Copper is stored until it is needed for a specific contract. When required, an administrator issues the copper by specifying the quantity, and the database is automatically updated to reflect the issued amount. This process ensures that the available copper is accurately tracked.

### 4. Return

Not all copper is consumed during a contract. Leftover pieces, known as offcuts (used, bent, or drilled), are recorded with their dimensions and stored in the database. This allows for the reuse of materials in future projects, minimizing waste.

### 5. Count

Upon completion of a contract, the total amount of copper used is measured and recorded in the count table. This helps in tracking the actual copper usage against the initial order, providing valuable data for future planning.

### 6. Audit

The audit feature allows users to select a contract and view a detailed report of copper usage, including any discrepancies. This function identifies how much copper is missing, helping to ensure accountability and accuracy in material management.
